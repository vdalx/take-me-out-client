## Lessons Learned

As a first 'blank canvas' project I tried to implement everything I had learned during my BrainStation adventure to varying levels of success.

From a UX Design persepective I learned two key lessons:

1. Start small with a clear concept of what you’re trying to achieve prior to beginning the user research process.
2. When interviewing and testing you must restrain yourself from “helping” the user.

From a Software Development perspective I learned two more key lessons:

1. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Looking for help when you're stuck isn't always a weakness and spending time trying to find a solution on your own isn't always a strength or the most productive use of your time.
2. Gaps in knowledge and understanding. There are a number of concepts I need to spend more time learning and practising and this project helped me identify what those are.

## Next Steps

At the moment this is a very basic app which doesn't capture all of the features I had originally envisaged. I would like to continue iterating on those features and make it function the way I had designed it.
